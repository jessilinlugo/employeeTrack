I hate databases, I hate MySQL. I've been deserting and returning to this assignment for the past few weeks, and I really just don't want to think about it anymore.

This application allows you to track the employees of a company. From Owner to Security, everyone is listed. You can sort views by Role, Employee or Manager names. You can update existing employees or add new ones, as well as add new departments and roles. 

I learned a lot of syntax trying to finish this. I know it's not perfect, but I learned a lot about reading error messages and following the trail.
